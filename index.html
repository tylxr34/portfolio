            <p>My name is Tylor Blackman. I am a Tucson native and have spent my entire life in this city. I have many hobbies including, but not limited to: photography, automotive, progamming, making games, and many other things.</p>

            My first introduction to programming began in my Junior year of high school. I signed up for a ne elective that was introduced as Software Development and Game Design. It involved making my own video games, both 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional, using the Unity Game Engine, all of whch were programmed using C#. We had also messed around with HTML5 as well as CSS.
            <br>
            After that school year I had entered my Senior class and signed up for Computer Science. We had first started off using SNAP for the new students to understand the fundamentals of progammin, and getting the idea that YOU need to tell the computer what to do. After around 1-2 months we entered Pyhton. The rest of the school year was fun learning a new language that was actually used in the field, it made me just as happy as the year before when I was first learning C#.
